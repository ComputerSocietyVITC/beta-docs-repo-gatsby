## Domain Specifics

My domain is Data Science and Machine Learning. This domain is all about getting insights from noisy data. The simplest analogy one can relate to is trying to catch a specific type of fish in an ocean full of different kinds of fish.

## Domain Use Cases

In today's world, where data is vast and eternal, trying to understand and get insights from data gets more tedious and complex by the minute. To get the best insights and to understand to data and put it in such a way that everyone can understand is where data science and machine learning comes into the picture. In this domain, it’s all about predicting outcomes, classifying objects and developing insights from the given data. The domain’s applications are vast, with data science and machine learning we can do all sorts of things such as image recognition, analysing sports performances, weather prediction and lots more.

## Software Development and Practices

Data Science and Machine learning is all about being resourceful and getting the best insights from the information given to you. Imagine an alien space ship lands on earth and you and group of data scientists try to understand the language the aliens communicate with, you and your team intuitively gather data and try to get the best insights from what the aliens are trying to communicate. In such a case, you would have limited amount of data your team’s analysis needs to be extremely accurate to see to that their communication can be understood to an optimal level.

## General Mistakes encountered while working with machine learning algorithms

One mistake I encountered while working in the domain of machine learning was directly trying to code machine learning models directly without understanding what the algorithm does and what are the outcomes by using the model. I would like people trying to work in this domain to have at least an intuitive idea about what the model does to get the desired outcomes.
