# Domain Specifics
I am a backend developer who is interested in MERN stack with typescript and have developed some projects in the same. My other interests include blockchain, cloud , and AI and ML. I am going to explain the cloud path here.
# Use cases
1) Scalability: Cloud computing allows you to use as many or as few resources as you need. 

2) Saving Costs: Cloud computing helps businesses to reduce costs in various ways. Companies only pay for the resources they use, making this process a more economical option than having to buy and manage their own resources. Cloud computing also results in considerable savings in Capital Expenditure and Operating Expenditure because companies do not have to invest in expensive hardware, storage devices, software, etc. 

3) Disaster Recovery: With all data stored in the ‘cloud’ backup and recovery of data and applications is quicker and more reliable. 

4) Security: It is the duty and responsibility of the cloud service providers to carefully monitor security 

5) Flexibility: When using cloud computing the number of options is vast. Depending on the size of the organization, business needs, workloads, etc. companies can choose cloud infrastructure and services accordingly.
