## Domain Specifics

Machine Learning is basically a subset of the Artificial Intelligence domain wherein the models are trained to act according to the environment. The goal in the machine learning is to recognize the pattern in the dataset, in general manner. After you recognize the patterns, you can use this information to model the data, to interpret the data, or to predict the outcome of the new data which hasn't seen before.

## Use Cases

Machine learning has become a prominent part in most of the new technologies to analyse and test data trends. The widely used domain in the recent times is the 'recommendation engine'. Many apps and websites use ML to analyse the way a user uses their application and what can be suggested based on these trends to make them glued to the application.
Other test cases include customer relationship management, human resource management and so on that play a vital role in predicting the
market trends.

Main points to be considered in the Software Development and Practices:

-   Human Augmentation -- have a human-in-the-loop review process
-   Bias Evaluation -- document, understand and monitor bias in  development and production
-   Explainability by reduction
-   Reproducible operations
-   Practical accuracy
-   Data Risk Accuracy
