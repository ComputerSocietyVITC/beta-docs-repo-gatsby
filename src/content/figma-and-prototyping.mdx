Its ability to export design elements and assets makes the integration of your designs into other tools and platforms a child’s play. It's no wonder why some of the world's largest companies, such as Google, Facebook, Uber, and Netflix, trust Figma to handle their design projects.

<h2>Roadmap on Learning Skills</h2>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

Create an Account in Figma

<h3>Plugins</h3>

Figma has a cool community tab where you can find great plugins which enhance your workflow. There are a lot of great plugins out there you can install directly on your account.

Since everything is happening on the cloud so you don’t have to download anything and it syncs across all your devices.

[https://www.figma.com/community](https://www.figma.com/community)

<h3>Community</h3>

Figma has a great feature that makes it stand out from its competitors. It’s the Community Tab. You can find and use thousands of files uploaded by designers from all around the world. Ranging from Icons and UI Kits to Illustrations, you can find everything on the Community Tab.

<h3>Advanced Features</h3>

<h4>Auto Layout</h4>

Auto layout is a property you can add to frames and components. It lets you create designs that grow to fill or shrink to fit, and reflow as their contents change.

<h3>Other Features</h3>

*  Styles — We can use styles to define the color, text and any effects applied to objects; or to define the structure and appearance of layout grids. We can create styles for paints and colors, text and more. You can find more about styles here.

*  Smart Animate — It’s one of the best prototyping features of Figma. You can select Smart Animate from the list of transitions when building a prototype. You can find out more about Smart Animate here.

*  More Features — The truth is Figma has tons of amazing things here. So instead of making this article long, what I did is I created a playlist on YouTube that contains all of its features explained briefly and up to the point by Figma itself. You can access that playlist here.

<h3>FigJam</h3>

Figma also recently launched FigJam. It’s an online whiteboard where you can brainstorm, and ideate together with your teams. FigJam and Figma live side-by-side, so all design work, from ideation to execution, can be found in one place. It has some amazing features like emojis and stamping which makes it fun to use.

<h2>Sketches</h2>

UX sketching is just rough hand drawing that is widely used for idea generation, communication, and improvement. It’s usually a step early on in the process. And it’s an essential skill and common practice that can help individuals or teams.

![Pencil Sketch](https://i.imgur.com/gSDA26s.png)

Almost every project begins with a sketch. Sometimes we take to the whiteboard, and other times our sketches are on paper. Hand sketches are an important part of the design process because they are free of technical limitations. The Sketch workflow is not considered. Designs cannot be overridden or perfected. The sketching phase is about getting concepts and ideas down on paper, not making a design perfect.

<h2>Starting with the UI/UX</h2>

<h3>Create a Team Project:-</h3>

-   To get started with Figma
    
    ![Welcome page](https://i.imgur.com/q8pDzkP.png)
    
-   Visit [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) and sign up for a free account.

-   Next, select a design type. The options are Figma or FigJam

-   Then, select a blank canvas to begin your design from scratch.

![Template](https://i.imgur.com/GxAe19G.png)

<h3>THE FIGMA EDITOR</h3>

-   The Figma editor is where you create your design files, prototype, and collaborate with your team.

    ![toolbar](https://i.imgur.com/k18Atsd.png)
    
-   At the very top, we have a dark toolbar.

- _Going from left to right:_

    - The **hamburger icon** gives you access to a dropdown menu with a lot of different options, similar to a native desktop application.

    - The **select tool** also comes with a scale tool with the dropdown arrow.

    - The next icon is the **artboard tool**, which allows you to create new artboards that are either custom or from a list of presets in the properties panel. The dropdown icon gives you access to a slice tool, which allows you to specify a region for exporting.

    - The **rectangle section** provides you with predefined geometric shapes.

    - The **pen tool** of course allows you to create custom shapes with anchor points, and it also comes with a pencil tool.

    - The **type tool** allows you to give input texts on your artboard.

    - The **chat icon** allows you to leave location-specific messages for communicating ideas and/or providing feedback.

    - The **share button** allows you to share the design and prototype with others.

    - The **play button** allows you to use the design and prototype.

    - The **eye icon** gives you access to some simple settings.

![layers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursetro/posts/content_images/4-1525116259046.png)

• To the very left is your **layers**. 

When you have multiple artboards, it's grouped into those artboards as shown above. When expanded, you gain access to individual layers, groups, and components.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218316860-b1df911e-5d6d-4ff2-b64e-79d36e03eb34.gif)

• The empty gray section to the right is the canvas where your artboard and design will appear.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218408759-9c5f3b7a-3889-446d-90a1-a4fc3f2b3025.gif)

• To the right is the **properties panel**. Depending on what is selected, the properties here will update. This gives you the ability to change colors, add effects, and more.

• It's also tabbed and includes a tab for Design, Prototype and Code. When you switch to **Prototype**, it allows you to create connections between elements of one artboard, to other artboards in your project.

• **Code** provides you with CSS properties based on the UI elements you select.

***Establish an Artboard***

An **artboard** is where you will place your design.

You need to select the artboard tool from the toolbar (as described above) and you will be provided with a list of artboard presets, as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218409101-ea115b19-1aaf-419c-a5eb-7634e7e6adf9.gif)

Figma provides you with plenty of presets.

On choosing any **preset**, you will be given a new **artboard** on the canvas, from which you can start designing.

Next, use the **rectangle tool** to draw out a similar-sized rectangle as shown below, and then in the **properties panel** to the right, give it a similar blue color for the background:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218411381-5797e3b8-c41f-43fe-a113-68812cc88f7c.gif)

***Modifying Shapes in Figma***

If you double-click on this new shape, you will be taken into **edit mode**, where you gain access to the **anchor points**. You can move around the anchor points, which will allow you to change the shape even more so.

You can also select the pen tool which is in this **edit mode**, and you can add an anchor point onto an existing shape:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218411569-44e0adba-7fc7-4c0a-b66f-3aa822489568.gif)

You can even use the **bend tool** for creating bezier curves on the anchor points, as shown above.

***Duplicating in Figma***

With our current shape selected, simply hit *CTRL-D* to duplicate the shape. You can also *CTRL-C* and *CTRL-V* (copy and paste) for the same behavior.

Select the original (the layer beneath the duplicated layer) and move it up with your keyboard arrow key and change the fill to a lighter blue.

Also, double-click on it to gain access to the anchor points and move the right anchor point up slightly, and the very left anchor point down to where you can't see it anymore:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218411948-36b3ab5c-2015-44f5-9635-e9f10abe4904.gif)

***Importing SVG's into Figma***

One handy feature is the ability to simply drag and drop **SVG files** from your desktop or folders, onto your canvas inside of Figma:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218412191-efa78a80-4abc-46a3-b3eb-14d4bb1530ed.gif)

This will provide you with a fully editable SVG file:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218412229-ac0a93c0-274b-479b-a51e-fa917f05dcfe.gif)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218412252-22b26cd1-baa5-4d79-8e1f-4328c060ec64.gif)

***Duplicating Artboards in Figma***

Select the name of the artboard and hit *CTRL-D*.

This will create an exact duplicate, positioned to the right of the original artboard. It will also show up as a new artboard in the layers panel on the left.

From here, you can begin to add or remove UI elements as needed.

***Importing Photographs in Figma***

Just as with SVG graphics, you can also drag and drop **photograph files** (JPGs and other bitmap files) onto the canvas, as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218412403-608e9b9b-0408-4847-9f1f-40fc3da12373.gif)

Now you can also use the power of layer blend modes to change the look of objects and photographs.

***Layer Blend Modes in Figma***

Using the example above with the traffic photograph, if you create a rectangle the same size as the photograph that's shown, place it beneath the traffic layer in the layers section, and make it a blue color, you can then change the blend mode of the traffic layer.

This will change the appearance of the traffic photograph, as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218412494-24fb211c-5a1c-49f0-ae28-c36473e6f37f.gif)


<h3>Prototyping in Figma</h3>

Figma’s prototyping feature has cutting-edge capabilities that are simple to use while still allowing you to develop interactive flows directly in the design file. You may quickly create a realistic representation of your website or product using static designs.

Prototyping is crucial for a variety of reasons. You can experiment with the new user flows. Inform your team of interactions. Test and get feedback from your users. And pitch designs to stakeholders for buy-in. 

First, let's go over some prototyping basics. Organize your designs and familiarise yourself with the key prototype tools. Your workflow will go more quickly and your designs will be maintained.

**Start by Organizing**

Whenever you are ready to begin prototyping, add a copy of every screen and component required to a new page. Put everything in a logical sequence and give it names that are easy to remember. You can utilize the same designs in numerous prototypes by using copies.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218414945-23f6dfdc-6a3f-4f47-8658-b8a266b76bb3.gif)

**Key Features**

A - Prototype panel

B - Add a new prototype flow 

C - Add and configure interactions

D - Add and configure overflow scrolling

E - Configure prototype settings

F - Present prototype


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218415151-a0975045-76be-4c16-9c5c-3538ffe0daf0.gif)

**Prototype Flows**

One or more prototype flows may exist for each page in your Figma file. Everyone must have a unique starting point and name.

- Click the "+" icon next to "Flow Starting Point" after choosing the first frame you want to include in your flow.
    
- After adding it, change the flow's name by clicking the name input. 
    
- By selecting the "Edit" icon next to the flow name, you can add a description.
    
- Click the "Delete" icon next to "Flow Starting Point" to remove the starting point.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218416305-d19c624d-6eef-49fa-a768-90dfa4ee01f6.gif)

**Create Connections**

You can add connections between any two layers (e.g. frames, groups, shapes, text layers, etc.) to navigate from one page to another.

- Select the source for the connection

- Click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218426773-d50d1d29-8a32-4d79-a58d-0d67cffec838.gif"  width="4%" height="9%"> icon to create the connection
    
- Drag the line that appears to the destination

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218416503-3bf19aec-caa9-4826-bbc3-7d371bc144b4.gif)

**Adding Interactions and Animations**

Interactions are the primary feature used when building a prototype. You can use them to add different behaviors and effects. They work by connecting two layers, then determining how those layers will interact with each other by adding a trigger, action and animation. Interactions can be simple with instate animations or they can be more complex with animated elements that move or change properties. 


*Trigger*: An event that causes a change e.g: tap, click, drag, hovering, pressing a key, mouse enter, mouse leave, etc 


*Action*: The Change that is happening. eg: Navigate to, change to, scroll to, back, open link, etc


*Animation*: The behavior/style of the change

- Open the Prototype tab in the right sidebar

- Add Interactions
    
- Set interaction details 

- Apply an animation

- Preview your animation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121488288/218416847-eaae0eab-ea75-4db9-bcb8-0b6e615009f3.gif)

**Instant Interactions**

Use "instant" animations to create static scenes where the action happens immediately. This works well for tasks like page switching or displaying a tooltip.

**Animated interactions**

You can use animations to add movement to your interactions and make the UI more interactive and stylish.  Dissolve, move in, move out, push, slide in, and slide out are the main animations available in Figma.
 
![image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e150c6768cf3e42d020d789/61390db1fc9d0ded52ac34c7_Animate%20C.gif)

**Easing Curves**

The animation's speed at the start, middle, and end are determined by easing curves. A linear animation will move continuously at the same speed. While an animation that is set to "ease in" will start slowly before picking up speed. The animation appears softer and more realistic when an easing curve is included.

**Adjust Prototype Settings**

- Select a Device and Model

- Preview your prototype

- Select a Background color

- Set the prototype’s Starting Frame

<h2>Pain points:</h2>

Pain points are specific problems faced by current or prospective customers in the marketplace. It includes any problems the customer may experience along their journey.

Some of the common problems faced by users are:

1. In Figma one cannot override text styles with an underline effect or font weight. It has to be unlinked first.

2. Multiple device prototypes within one page are not available.

3. The image composition tools available in Figma are not as great as Photoshop for good.

4. In Figma one cannot map corner radius as a style.

5. In Figma one cannot map space as a style as well.

6. Setting up min/max width/height cannot be done.

7. Dynamic nested components without going into a rabbit hole cannot be done.

8. In Figma we cannot have breakpoints for components.

9. We cannot create responsive prototypes.

10. There is no spell check available.

<h2> Useful Extensions </h2>

Figma as simple as it is is made even simpler by using prototyping some of the prototyping extensions are: 

1. Autoflow

    - Autoflow is the best and easy tool to create a quick user flow. You can just create user flow in a wee bit of time by just creating shapes and connecting them.

2. Batch Styler

    - Batch Styler lets you change many multiple colors and fonts at once. This plugin will save a lot of time by changing the whole design system with a single click.

3. Zeplin

    - Zeplin is an all-in-one handoff and organization tool. You can easily create user flows and organize your design files with variants to keep desktop, tablet, and mobile screens in one place. Zeplin also auto-generates design tokens from colors and fonts from your designs.

4. Chart

    - The chart is a plugin for Figma that uses real random data to create the most popular charts. Chart supports copy-paste from editors like Excel, Numbers, Google Sheets, live connection with Google Sheets and remote JSON (REST API), local CSV, and JSON files.

5. Content Reel

    - Content Reel is one place where you can get EVERYTHING, literally everything; from images to text strings to icons, and also Avatars. I use this plugin very often and this plugin is created by Microsoft. This is the most important and time-saving plugin for ME.

Some useful design extensions that will not only accelerate your design process but also make sure that you can express your skills in the best way possible are: -

6. Typescale
 
    - As a designer, it is obvious that typography and hierarchy play a crucial role. One of the most useful tools for efficiently creating type scales is Typescale.
 
7. Unsplash

    - Unsplash is particularly popular because it allows for the quick and easy import of a large number of images with just one click.
 
8. UIGradients

    - This plugin offers the ability to effortlessly incorporate a wide variety of gradients into designs with the convenience of a single click.
