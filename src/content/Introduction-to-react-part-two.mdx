This Learning path is made on the assumption that the user posesses  Basic Knowledge of React.

[Check out How to learn React Efficeintly if you dont meet the prerequisites.](https://docs.ieeecsvitc.com/docs/react-part-one/)

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. Libraries in programming languages are collections of prewritten code that users can use to optimize tasks.

As you progress in React, you'll encounter advanced concepts like state management, routing, lifecycle methods, higher-order components (HOCs), render props, error boundaries, and code splitting. These concepts enable you to handle application data, manage navigation, control component behavior, reuse code, handle errors gracefully, and optimize performance. Understanding and applying these concepts will enhance your React development skills.

## Domain Specifics
Web development as we know it is broadly classified into 2 definite parts The Front end and The Back end. Front end is the interface with which the user interacts/the part of the website visible to the user. The backend on the other hand is behind the hood stuff which is usually not visible to the user.

React JS in a nutshell is just a framework (a tool to build things).React JS replaces Vanilla JavaScript by building User interactive websites in a efficient manner with significantly less code.
JavaScript Frameworks have been popping up left and right in the web development domain dominating the front end as well as the backend world. In the Front-end part of things popular frameworks include Vue JS, Angular JS, React js etc.
In the Web Development Puzzle React JS fits Right into Easier, Efficient and better front development as a piece. Hence better Front combined with a solid Backend makes your Full Stack App much livelier and better. 

## Use Cases
Well, Why React among the popular options you have or why not just go with Vanilla JavaScript?
- Larger Community, That Bug which is been disturbing your piece of mind for hours is more likely to be fixed now by your friendly neighborhood React Dev.
- Easier Learning Curve, If you are fairly new JavaScript Developer you it would be easy for you to pickup react because of the simplicity and easy starting point as opposed to some frameworks such as Angular with TypeScript as a prerequisite.
- Usage of components, Components are reusable code which reduces redundant code in your application. Incase of Vanilla JS redundancy of code is observed in lot of places components provide  a simple solution for that.
Software Development and practices

## Software Development and practices
A Important Principle while developing a react application is to “Think in React” which includes breaking down the UI of the  website one by one into components and deciding which parts of the website should be used as components in order to reuse them as much as possible. 
Developing a component hierarchy after you have decided on the components is necessary. You can further follow the general software design principle (S.O.L.I.D) in a react application.

## General Mistakes 
-  Not creating Multiple components: Creating as many components as provided are highly reusable is a good practice often you have to apply the “Think in React Principles” Achieve this.
- Modifying the state directly: In React, state should be immutable. If you modify the state directly, it’ll cause performance issues that are difficult to fix.
- Using Redux to manage all States: With bigger React apps, many developers use Redux to manage global state. While Redux is useful, you don’t need to use it to manage every state in your apps.
