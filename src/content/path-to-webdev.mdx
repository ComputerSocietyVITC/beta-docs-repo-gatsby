## Web development speciﬁcs

Web dev, as the name suggests it is used to develop websites or used to update any existing websites with newer technologies, web development for the past many years is a developing ﬁeld starting from web1 where we used to read the wikipedia pages and then at web2 where we started liking and commenting on facebook now to web3 where we can decentralize our data, so taking a domain as a web development is always an added advantage even though if you wish to switch onto any other ﬁeld in future

## Web development use cases

Imagine you have a great knowledge in AI ML or any other ﬁeld, but now if you want to show your work to all the people worldwide, you can't carry your laptop everywhere and run it in front of everyone, at that time the knowledge of web development is useful to you, where you can add your project in a website and deploy it to an domain name and access in any device or at any place as mentioned web development is always an added advantage even though if your working on any other ﬁeld.

## Software Development and practices

- Web development is a speciﬁc type of software development that involves building application for the web, web developers use a variety of technologies starting from HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive and dynamic websites and web applications
- Agile development: Agile development is a method of software development that emphasizes ﬂexibility and collaboration. It involves working in short cycles, called "sprints," and regularly adapting to changing requirements and priorities.
- Test-driven development (TDD): TDD is a software development practice in which tests are written before the code they are testing. This helps developers to ensure that their code is reliable and meets the requirements.
- Continuous integration (CI): CI is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a staging or production environment. This helps developers to detect and ﬁx errors quickly, and to deploy code changes more frequently.
- Pair programming: Pair programming is a software development practice in which two developers work together on the same codebase. This helps to improve code quality and to share knowledge and ideas.
- Code review: Code review is a practice in which developers review each other's code in order to identify and ﬁx errors, improve code quality, and share knowledge and best practices.

## Roadmap

It's always advised to ﬁrst try the basic full stack development and then go on intermediate level in a speciﬁc side such as front-end or backend maybe both too

**Basic Roadmap for a Full stack developer**

- Learn HTML and CSS: These are the building blocks of the web.
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout that content.
- Learn JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.
- Learn a web framework: A web framework is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easier to develop web applications. Some popular frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- Learn a server-side language: A server-side language is used to build the backend of a web application. Some popular server-side languages include Python, Ruby, and Java.
- Learn about databases: A database is a way to store and organize data for a web application. Some popular databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- Learn about version control: Version control is a way to track changes to your codebase and collaborate with other developers. Git is a popular version control system.
- Learn about deployment: Deployment is the process of making your web application available online for others to access. There are many ways to deploy a web application, including using a platform like Heroku or setting up your own server.
- Continue learning and staying up to date: The ﬁeld of web development is constantly evolving, so it's important to continue learning and staying up to date with new technologies and best practices.

## Intermediate Roadmap for Frontend developer

- Deepen your understanding of JavaScript: As an intermediate developer, you should have a solid foundation in JavaScript. However, there is always more to learn, and you can continue to improve your skills by exploring advanced concepts such as functional programming, asynchronous programming, and design patterns.
- Improve your design skills: A strong eye for design and an understanding of user experience (UX) principles can set you apart as a frontend developer. Consider learning about design principles, user research, and user testing in order to create more effective and engaging web experiences.
- Explore new JavaScript frameworks: As an intermediate developer, you may want to consider learning additional JavaScript frameworks in order to expand your skill set and increase your versatility as a developer.
- Learn about web security: As a frontend developer, you should have a basic understanding of web security principles and best practices.
- This includes topics such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and secure communication.
- Stay up to date with the latest frontend technologies and best practices

## Intermediate Roadmap for Backend developer

- Learn a server-side programming language: As an intermediate backend developer, you should have a solid foundation in at least one server-side programming language such as Python, Java, or Ruby. You can continue to improve your skills in this language by exploring advanced concepts and learning about design patterns
  and best practices.
- Learn about databases and data modeling: As a backend developer, you will likely work with databases to store and retrieve data for your applications. Familiarizing yourself with different database technologies, such as SQL and NoSQL databases, and learning about data modeling can help you design efficient and scalable
  data storage solutions.
- Learn about web security: Web security is an important aspect of backend development. You should have a basic understanding of topics such as authentication, authorization, and secure communication. Yo u can deepen your knowledge in this area by learning about common web security vulnerabilities and how to prevent and mitigate them.
- Learn about cloud computing: Many modern applications are built using cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Learning about these platforms and how to deploy and manage applications on
  them can be a valuable skill for a backend developer.
- Explore different backend frameworks: There are many backend frameworks available that can make it easier to build and deploy applications. By learning about diꢀerent frameworks and how they can be used, you can become more versatile as a backend developer.

## Personal Projects:

[This link will direct you to an youtube video, after learning the basic full stack, it's now time to implement your knowledge, this particular project video covers each and every part of full stack, it's a really helpful](https://youtu.be/VsUzmlZfYNg)

**Backend development course in spring boot;**

The below is a link for a Spring boot course, it's an server side language which can be coded in java, personally i have used java for my server side, it's your wish to go on any server side language and appropriate videos are easily found on youtube

[Sprint boot course](https://youtu.be/Uh-N_6Lccr4)

### Reference Projects

#### Portfolio Website

- making your own portfolio website for yourself. Showcase your projects, your social media handles, your experience on the website.
- Requirements: Responsiveness, UX design, HTML, CSS, Icons

#### To do List WebApp

- This is a common project that all web developers have done at least once in their lifetime. Not only will this help you to keep track of your daily tasks but is a good project too at least at the beginner level
- Requirements: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#### Amazon Clone using React

- It's a bit advanced project, where you should be more expertise in backend development, but creating an project like this will deﬁnitely give an value to your resume
- Requirements: ReactJS, JavaScript, SpringBoot, Mongodb, AWS(for deployment), API
